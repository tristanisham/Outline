 Generate a web book for your code, game, or anything!
 
 ## What is Outline?
Outline is a sister/sucsessor application to [Wingman](https://github.com/tristanisham/Wingman), a static site generator built in Rust. Where Wingman was designed to target new web developers and focuses on a broad array of small static minimalist sites, Outline is focused on providing one thing: An easy web book generator.

One of the nicest parts of developing rust is the near-standard "book" design for documentation. Thanks to sites like [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs) and [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) its easy to go through documentation and other long digital first resources without obstructions. Yes, it'd be easy to make your own, but creating a nice generator to help promote this as the documentation format (and providing tools to export and share your web book) is another step in the journey of improving documentation on the web.
